TikTok Saved Audios Downloader
This project is a web crawler designed to help TikTok users download all their saved audios. The script automates interactions with an existing web service to facilitate the downloads.

Features
Utilizes the user_data_tiktok.json file (not the text export of user data) to identify saved audios.
Automates interfacing with an existing web service to download files.
Saves the downloaded audios to a user-defined output directory.
Prerequisites
TikTok Data Export:

You must obtain your user_data_tiktok.json file from TikTok.
This JSON file contains the necessary metadata to locate and download your saved audios.
Ensure this file is placed in the working directory of the script for proper functionality.
Python Installed:

Make sure you have Python (3.8 or later) installed on your system.
Setup Instructions

1. Install Dependencies
   All required dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install them:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt 2. Place the Required JSON File
Ensure that your user_data_tiktok.json file is in the same directory as the script. The crawler cannot function without this file.

3. Specify the Output Directory
   Identify the directory where you want the audios to be saved.
   Modify the script or provide the output directory path when prompted during runtime.
   To find the path to your desired directory:
   On Windows: Right-click the folder, select "Properties," and copy the path.
   On macOS/Linux: Right-click the folder and select "Get Info" or "Properties" to find the path.
   How It Works
   Automated Web Service Interaction:

The script doesn't download the audios directly.
It automates interactions with an existing web service to handle the downloading process.
Saved Audio Metadata:

The user_data_tiktok.json file contains metadata about your saved audios.
The script parses this file to retrieve the audio links.
Output Files:

Audios are downloaded and saved to the output directory specified by the user.
Running the Script
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the script and user_data_tiktok.json file are located.
Run the script:
bash
Copy
Edit
python script_name.py
Provide the output directory path when prompted.
Notes
No Text File Support: The script is incompatible with text-based exports of your data. Only the user_data_tiktok.json file is supported.
Output Directory: Make sure the specified directory exists and is writable.
Dependencies: Ensure all dependencies from requirements.txt are properly installed.
